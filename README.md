Defaulting on a loan happens when repayments aren't made for a certain period.
Defaulting will drastically reduce your credit score, impact your ability to receive future credit, and can lead to the seizure of personal property (vehicle).
The probability of default, sometimes abbreviated as POD or PD, expresses the likelihood the borrower will not maintain the financial capability to make scheduled debt payments.
There are several major variables to consider: the financial health of the borrower; the severity of the consequences of a default for the borrower and the creditor; the size of the credit extension; historical trends in default rates; and a variety of macroeconomic considerations.
We are trying to identify these factors and predict the probability of a borrower defaulting on the loan with the demographic and financial information present in the dataset, so that financial institutions providing vehicle loans can make better and smarter decision based on a customer portfolio. The variables we would consider for the prediction are loan default (Payment default in the first EMI on due date), asset cost (cost of the asset),  age ( customer age), employment type (employment type : salaried, self-employment and unemployed), credit history length (Time since first loan).
